# tdd-strict-equal

*Identify the component of this assignment that you did
the best on, and why: I felt accomplished to be able to run through all the steps of the TDD and have everything click. It was great to finally get a passing test!
*Describe in plain English what problem this assignment
was posing, and what your solution was to it: I was having a little trouble understanding the TDD process. I stepped back from the hw, looked at some resources to better understand the flow and reasoning, and then went back to the hw to try to tackle the process.
*What was your approach or process: I began by setting up the repo, installing all the dependencies and then modifying the package.json file. I set up all the files I would be needing, and then began writing my test. After I successfully ran a failing test, I wrote my function and then tweaked it until I was able to get a passing test.
*What were your challenges: My biggest challenge was understanding the TDD process. It felt odd at first, like I was starting from the end. After going through a few resources describing it, it clicked.
*What resources did you use: javascript.info, a youtube video about TDD, Javascript: the Definitive Guide book, MDN/npm documentation
